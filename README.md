# SUs-Generation-Use-PSO-SLIC
That is a repository for automated slope units generation.
Input data can be customized during the experiment, and the PSO-SLIC model will adaptively select key parameters according to the input data for the construction of the SLIC model, thus completing the unit segmentation. It is worth noting that this method is not only applicable to extraction of slope units, but also applicable to other image segmentation based on homogeneity.
